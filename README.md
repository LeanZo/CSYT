CSYT is a free and open source program that allow you to watch Youtube videos while doing other stuff. It acts like an pop-up, being on top of another windows, you can resize and drag it around the screen.

## Motivation

I watch a lot of Youtube videos and always wanted for an easy way to watch and do other stuff, like navigate on Reddit. I know there are probably better solutions, but for the sake of learning and fun, I decided to made my own.
